<div class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;line-height:20.4pt;margin:0 0 7.5pt;"><span lang="EN" style="font-family:'Arial', 'sans-serif';font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">Microsoft intends its new Windows Azure Services Platform to be a serious cloud computing platform for a broad range of developers and scenarios, from lone developers starting up a new Web-based company on a shoestring to large teams of enterprise developers looking for high-performance, highly available, and scalable Web sites, computing, and storage. A few years out, Microsoft wants Azure to be seen as the preferred location for enterprise data, not as a business risk. It's off to a good start.</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="background:white;line-height:20.4pt;margin:0 0 10pt;"><span lang="EN" style="font-family:'Arial', 'sans-serif';font-size:9pt;"><span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;">There's a tremendous amount of capability being presented in the Azure CTP (Community Technology Preview), and there's more to come. It goes beyond simple Web hosting to a flexible architecture designed to automatically enlist additional resources in response to demand. There are capabilities here that I haven't seen in competing cloud offerings -- for example, workflows. The Azure team has picked and chosen existing Microsoft technologies -- virtual servers, the .Net Framework, IIS, worker processes, databases, queues, enterprise service bus, workflows, authentication, and so on -- and adapted them to the cloud.</span></span></div><span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;"></span>
