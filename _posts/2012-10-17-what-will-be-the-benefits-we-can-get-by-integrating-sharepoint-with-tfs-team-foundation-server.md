<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><span style="color:black;font-family:'Arial', 'sans-serif';"><span>Microsoft introduced Team Foundation Server (TFS) to fulfill the collaboration activity of software development life cycle. This activity includes source control, data collection, reporting, and project tracking. We can use TFS by itself or can be collaborate with Visual studio team system. Team Explorer of TFS is a tool which provides you the option to get information insight the projects. SharePoint is not a mandatory component to use TFS but need to use for great benefits.</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><span style="color:black;font-family:'Arial', 'sans-serif';"><span>SharePoint integration is simply allowing Product manager, Project manager easy access to get project information without entering into development environment. SharePoint just gives non-technical users access to information that is business critical, but housed in TFS. There is nothing that will not happen if you don’t have a TFS public interface, everything works just the same. All the functionality that TFS can provide is exposed through its integration with Visual Studio. Project manager want to view the task progress status, high priority task list and open task, unresolved bugs release status etc. He can view and manage these jobs on project site in SharePoint without interacting team explorer of TFS. And need not to interact with development environment.</span></span><br /><span style="color:black;font-family:'Arial', 'sans-serif';"><span></span></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://techforumugm.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/91f71-tfs.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://techforumugm.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/91f71-tfs.jpg?w=286" width="304" /></a></div><span style="color:black;font-family:'Arial', 'sans-serif';"><span></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:black;font-family:'Arial', 'sans-serif';">SharePoint developer perspective, there are custom web parts in the project web site that, based on your user ID, will tell you what tasks you have left. All of this is integrated into the development tools that you would be using to develop anyway, such as Visual Studio. </span> <span style="color:black;font-family:'Arial', 'sans-serif';">When you create a new TFS project, you are given the option to create a SharePoint portal site along with it. Business analyst and QC who has access to that SharePoint site can log defects or requirements or any other task can be done through SharePoint project site that TFS created when the project was set up.</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0 0 10pt;"><span><span style="color:black;font-family:'Arial', 'sans-serif';">TFS with SharePoint implementation will increase the quality of your software and save you money from what you would have spent on tools that were needed in the past.</span></span></div>
