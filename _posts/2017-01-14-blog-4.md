Azure Stream Analytics aims to extract knowledge structures from continuous ordered streams of data by real-time analysis.These streams might include computer network traffic, social network data, phone conversations, sensor readings, ATM transactions or web searches. Azure Stream Analytics is a fully managed, cost effective real-time event processing engine that helps to unlock deep insights from data.

<ul>
	<li>Intake millions of events per second (up to 1 GB/s) at variable loads</li>
	<li>Scale that accommodates variable loads</li>
	<li>Low processing latency, auto adaptive (sub-second to seconds)</li>
	<li>Transform, augment, correlate, temporal operations</li>
	<li>Correlate between different streams, or with reference data</li>
	<li>Find patterns or lack of patterns in data in real-time</li>
	<li>Elasticity of the cloud for scale out</li>
	<li>No hardware (PaaS offering)</li>
	<li>Rapid development
