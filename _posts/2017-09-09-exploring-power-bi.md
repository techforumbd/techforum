Power BI consists of a Windows desktop application called <strong>Power BI Desktop</strong>, an online SaaS (<em>Software as a Service</em>) service called the <strong>Power BI service</strong>, and mobile Power BI <strong>apps</strong> available on Windows phones and tablets, as well as for iOS and Android devices.These three elements – the <strong>Desktop</strong>, the <strong>service</strong>, and <strong>Mobile</strong> – are designed to let people create, share, and consume business insights in the way that serves them, or their role, most effectively.
