<p class="lf-text-block lf-block">Let’s start our tour at the dashboard and look at the tiles the CMO has chosen to pin. We see information about our market share, sales, and sentiment. And we see that data broken down by region, time, and competition.<span class="lf-thread-btn"><a class="fycon-action-view">+</a></span></p>

<ul class="lf-text-block lf-block">
	<li>The number tiles down the left column show industry sales volume this past year (50K), market share (32.86%), sales volume (16K), sentiment score (68), sentiment gap (4), and total units sold (1M).</li>
	<li>The top line chart shows how our market share fluctuates over time. Our market share really drops in June. Also, our R12M (Rolling 12 Months) share which was increasing for a while, is starting to stall.</li>
	<li>Our biggest competitor is Aliqui (evident in the middle column chart tile.)</li>
	<li>Most of our business is in the East and Central regions.</li>
	<li>The line chart at the bottom shows that our dip in June is not seasonal – none of our competitors show the same trend.</li>
	<li class="">The two “Total Units” tiles show units sold, by segment and by region/manufacturer. The largest market segment for our industry are <strong>Productivity</strong> and <strong>Convenience</strong>.</li>
</ul>
